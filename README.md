**The Foundational Triad of Human Experience: Voir, Savoir, and Pouvoir**

In the intricate dance of human existence, we often look for patterns, frameworks, or guiding principles to make sense of the world around us. One such comprehensive framework, dubbed "everything-in-a-nutshell," seeks to explain the foundational aspects of human existence through a triad of concepts: Voir, Savoir, and Pouvoir. These three pillars, although distinct, intertwine seamlessly, providing a unified perspective on the biological, psychological, and sociological facets of human life.

**1. Voir: The Biological Prism of Perception**
At the heart of "Voir" lies the mechanism of how we perceive the world. This pillar emphasizes the interaction between photons and the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN). Photons, the primary particles of light, play a pivotal role in our visual perception. They interact with the SCN, a part of our brain responsible for controlling our circadian rhythms, impacting our sleep-wake cycles and overall homeostasis.

In the realm of biochemistry, Voir centers around catecholamines, a group of neurotransmitters that include dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. These endogenous ligands bind to specific receptors, modulating our responses to stress and influencing our mood, attention, and overall catabolic homeostasis.

**2. Savoir: The Psychological Balance of Knowledge**
Savoir dives into the CLOCK-BMAL1 molecular mechanism, which forms the core of our biological clocks. This interaction plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, from metabolism to behavior. The balance between ATP, the primary energy currency of cells, and its breakdown product, adenosine, underscores the principle of allostasis. As adenosine accumulates, it binds to its receptors, leading to feelings of drowsiness and promoting sleep.

On the psychological front, Savoir revolves around the interactions between nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. While the endogenous ligand acetylcholine binds to both, exogenous ligands such as nicotine (from tobacco) and muscarine (from certain mushrooms) can selectively activate these receptors. This selective activation has profound implications on cognition, memory, and arousal.

**3. Pouvoir: The Sociological Power of Rituals**
The final pillar, Pouvoir, brings forth the sociological perspective, emphasizing the role of PER-TIM interactions in controlling our biological clocks. This pillar juxtaposes anabolic processes, which build up our body's molecules, against the drowsy state of sociostasis, where societal norms and routines maintain stability.

At the heart of Pouvoir is the sociology of rituals. These shared, repetitive practices bind communities together, providing a sense of belonging and purpose. Biochemically, GABA (Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid), an inhibitory neurotransmitter, becomes the focal point. GABA regulates neuronal excitability, and its receptors are targeted by various substances, from endogenous ligands to common exogenous agents like alcohol and commercial medications such as benzodiazepines.

In conclusion, the "everything-in-a-nutshell" framework captures the essence of human existence by intertwining biological, psychological, and sociological perspectives. By understanding the foundational tokens of Voir, Savoir, and Pouvoir, we gain a holistic view of the human experience, from the microscopic interactions of molecules to the macroscopic rituals that bind societies together.
